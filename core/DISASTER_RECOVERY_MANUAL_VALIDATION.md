**Date**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Manual validation of disaster recovery procedures  
**Duration**: 2-4 hours  
**Participants**: DevOps team, System administrators  

## üìã Pre-Validation Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Access to production environment
- [ ] Backup credentials and access
- [ ] Communication channels established
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Team notifications sent

### Safety Measures
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Monitoring alerts temporarily disabled
- [ ] Rollback plan ready

## üö® Scenario 1: Complete System Failure

### Objective
Validate recovery from complete system outage including database, application, and infrastructure failures.

### Test Steps

#### 1.1 Simulate Complete Outage
```bash
# Stop all AURA services
sudo systemctl stop aura-api
sudo systemctl stop aura-workers
sudo systemctl stop redis
sudo systemctl stop postgresql

# Verify services are down
sudo systemctl status aura-api
sudo systemctl status aura-workers
```

#### 1.2 Validate Monitoring Alerts
- [ ] Check that monitoring system detects outage
- [ ] Verify alert notifications are sent
- [ ] Confirm incident response team is notified
- [ ] Validate alert severity levels

#### 1.3 Execute Recovery Procedures

**Step 1: Infrastructure Recovery**
```bash
# Restart core infrastructure
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo systemctl start redis

# Verify database connectivity
psql -h localhost -U aura_user -d aura_db -c "SELECT 1;"
redis-cli ping
```

**Step 2: Application Recovery**
```bash
# Restart application services
sudo systemctl start aura-api
sudo systemctl start aura-workers

# Verify service health
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health
curl -f http://localhost:8000/ready
```

**Step 3: Data Integrity Check**
```bash
# Verify event store integrity
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('/opt/aura/src')
from aura_intelligence.core.event_store import EventStore
store = EventStore()
print(f'Events in store: {store.count_events()}')
print(f'Projections healthy: {store.check_projections()}')
"
```

#### 1.4 Success Criteria
- [ ] All services restored within 15 minutes
- [ ] No data loss detected
- [ ] Event processing resumes normally
- [ ] Monitoring shows healthy status
- [ ] No manual intervention required after initial recovery

### Expected Results
- **Recovery Time**: < 15 minutes
- **Data Loss**: 0 events
- **Service Health**: All green
- **User Impact**: Minimal (during maintenance window)

## üóÑÔ∏è Scenario 2: Database Corruption

### Objective
Validate recovery from database corruption with data restoration from backups.

### Test Steps

#### 2.1 Simulate Database Corruption
```bash
# Create backup before corruption
pg_dump aura_db > /tmp/aura_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Simulate corruption (BE CAREFUL!)
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
sudo rm /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_wal/*
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

#### 2.2 Execute Database Recovery
```bash
# Stop application services
sudo systemctl stop aura-api
sudo systemctl stop aura-workers

# Restore from backup
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/*
sudo -u postgres initdb -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
sudo systemctl start postgresql

# Restore database
psql -h localhost -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE aura_db;"
psql -h localhost -U aura_user -d aura_db < /tmp/aura_backup_*.sql
```

#### 2.3 Validate Data Integrity
```bash
# Check event count
psql -h localhost -U aura_user -d aura_db -c "
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_events FROM events;
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_debates FROM debates;
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_projections FROM projections;
"

# Verify projection consistency
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('/opt/aura/src')
from aura_intelligence.core.projections import ProjectionManager
pm = ProjectionManager()
print(f'Projection lag: {pm.get_lag_seconds()}s')
print(f'Projection health: {pm.get_health_status()}')
"
```

#### 2.4 Success Criteria
- [ ] Database restored from backup
- [ ] All events preserved
- [ ] Projections rebuild successfully
- [ ] Application services resume
- [ ] Data consistency verified

### Expected Results
- **Recovery Time**: < 30 minutes
- **Data Loss**: 0 events (from backup)
- **Consistency**: Event store and projections match
- **Service Health**: All green after recovery

## üåê Scenario 3: Network Partition

### Objective
Validate system behavior during network partitions and recovery.

### Test Steps

#### 3.1 Simulate Network Partition
```bash
# Create network partition between services
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j DROP
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 6379 -j DROP
```

#### 3.2 Monitor System Behavior
```bash
# Check service health during partition
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || echo "API unreachable"
redis-cli ping || echo "Redis unreachable"

# Monitor logs for error handling
tail -f /var/log/aura/application.log | grep -E "(ERROR|WARN|Circuit|Backoff)"
```

#### 3.3 Execute Recovery
```bash
# Remove network restrictions
sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j DROP
sudo iptables -D OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 6379 -j DROP

# Verify connectivity restored
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health
redis-cli ping
```

#### 3.4 Success Criteria
- [ ] System detects network partition
- [ ] Circuit breakers activate appropriately
- [ ] Graceful degradation occurs
- [ ] Automatic recovery when network restored
- [ ] No data loss during partition

### Expected Results
- **Detection Time**: < 30 seconds
- **Degradation**: Graceful with reduced functionality
- **Recovery Time**: < 2 minutes after network restore
- **Data Integrity**: Maintained throughout

## üìä Scenario 4: Performance Degradation

### Objective
Validate system behavior under extreme load and recovery.

### Test Steps

#### 4.1 Simulate High Load
```bash
# Generate high load
for i in {1..1000}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/debates \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"topic": "test", "agents": ["analyst"]}' &
done
wait
```

#### 4.2 Monitor System Response
```bash
# Check system metrics
top -p $(pgrep -f aura)
free -h
df -h

# Monitor application metrics
curl -s http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep -E "(requests_total|response_time|error_rate)"
```

#### 4.3 Execute Recovery Procedures
```bash
# Scale up resources if needed
sudo systemctl restart aura-workers
sudo systemctl restart redis

# Verify recovery
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health
```

#### 4.4 Success Criteria
- [ ] System handles load gracefully
