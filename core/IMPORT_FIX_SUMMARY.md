# Import Fix Summary

## ðŸ”§ Fixed Issue: Relative Import Error

### Problem
- **File**: `src/aura_common/logging/shadow_mode.py`
- **Line**: 12
- **Error**: `ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package`
- **Cause**: The file was trying to import from `aura_intelligence` using a relative import path (`from ...aura_intelligence.observability.shadow_mode_logger`) that went beyond the package boundary.

### Solution Applied
Changed the relative import to an absolute import:
```python
# Before (incorrect):
from ...aura_intelligence.observability.shadow_mode_logger import (
    ShadowModeLogger as _OriginalShadowModeLogger,
    ShadowModeEntry,
    ShadowModeAnalytics
)

# After (correct):
from aura_intelligence.observability.shadow_mode_logger import (
    ShadowModeLogger as _OriginalShadowModeLogger,
    ShadowModeEntry,
    ShadowModeAnalytics
)
```

### Why This Works
- The test files add `/workspace/core/src` to the Python path
- This makes both `aura_common` and `aura_intelligence` available as top-level packages
- Absolute imports between these packages are the correct approach

## ðŸ“Š Additional Findings

### 1. Package Structure
```
/workspace/core/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ aura_common/          # Common utilities package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ errors/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ logging/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ shadow_mode.py  # The file we fixed
â””â”€â”€ aura_intelligence/     # Main intelligence package
    â””â”€â”€ observability/
        â””â”€â”€ shadow_mode_logger.py  # The module being imported
```

### 2. Import Pattern Analysis
- Only ONE file in `aura_common` imports from `aura_intelligence`: `shadow_mode.py`
- Multiple files in `aura_intelligence` import from `aura_common` (this is the correct direction)
- The test files consistently use `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent / "src"))` to set up imports

### 3. Dependency Note
While testing the fix, I discovered that the modules require external dependencies (structlog, pydantic, etc.) that aren't installed in the bare Python environment. However, this is separate from the import path issue, which has been correctly resolved.

## âœ… Result
The relative import error in `shadow_mode.py` has been fixed. The file now uses the correct absolute import path that matches the project's package structure and import conventions.
