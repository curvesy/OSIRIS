## 📊 Architecture Comparison

### Before: Monolithic Approach
```python
# phase3d_active_mode_deployment.py (500+ lines)
class ActiveModeDeployment:
    def __init__(self):
        # All functionality mixed together
        self.risk_calculation = ...
        self.database_operations = ...
        self.metrics_tracking = ...
        self.action_execution = ...
        self.human_approval = ...
    
    def process_decision(self):
        # 100+ lines of mixed concerns
        # Risk assessment
        # Database operations  
        # Metrics recording
        # Action execution
        # Human approval
        # All in one method!
```

### After: Professional Modular Approach
```python
# Clean orchestration with focused components
class ActiveModeDeployment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.risk_engine = RiskAssessmentEngine()      # Risk only
        self.database = GovernanceDatabase()           # Data only
        self.metrics = MetricsManager()                # Metrics only
        self.executor = ActionExecutor()               # Execution only
        self.approval = HumanApprovalManager()         # Approval only
    
    async def process_decision(self):
        # Clean orchestration of focused components
        risk_score = await self.risk_engine.calculate_risk_score(...)
        decision = self._create_decision(...)
        await self._process_by_risk_level(decision)
        self.metrics.record_decision(decision, response_time)
        self.database.store_decision(decision)
```
