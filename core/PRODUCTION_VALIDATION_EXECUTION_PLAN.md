# üéØ AURA Intelligence Production Validation Execution Plan

*Created: January 2025*  
*Objective: Achieve full operational signoff before advancing to Project Chimera*

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines the exhaustive validation plan for AURA Intelligence's event-driven core and agent debate framework. We will execute comprehensive testing in production-like conditions, focusing on replay capabilities, resilience, operational metrics, and disaster recovery.

**Key Principle**: No new features until full operational signoff is achieved.

    validation:
      - Backpressure activates appropriately
      - System remains responsive
      - Automatic scaling triggers
      - No OOM kills occur
```

### Suite 3: Operational Metrics Validation

```yaml
metrics_validation:
  - category: "Event Processing"
    metrics:
      - event_processing_duration_seconds
      - event_processing_errors_total
      - event_store_size_bytes
    validation:
      - Metrics update within 1 second
      - Values accurate within 1% margin
      - No metric gaps during failures
  
  - category: "Debate System"
    metrics:
      - active_debates_gauge
      - debate_consensus_rate
      - agent_response_time_seconds
    validation:
      - Real-time accuracy
      - Historical data retention
      - Aggregation correctness
```

### Suite 4: Disaster Recovery Drill

```yaml
dr_scenarios:
  - name: "Complete Data Center Loss"
    steps:
      1. Simulate primary DC failure
      2. Activate DR site
      3. Restore from backups
      4. Validate data integrity
      5. Resume normal operations
    rto_target: "< 1 hour"
    rpo_target: "< 5 minutes"
    
  - name: "Ransomware Recovery"
    steps:
      1. Simulate encryption of primary data
      2. Isolate affected systems
      3. Restore from immutable backups
      4. Validate no data corruption
      5. Resume with clean systems
    validation:
      - Backup immutability verified
      - Recovery procedures documented
      - No data loss confirmed
```

## üîÑ Feedback Integration Process

### 1. Operator Feedback Collection
```yaml
feedback_channels:
  - source: "On-call engineers"
    method: "Post-incident reviews"
    frequency: "After each incident"
    
  - source: "SRE team"
    method: "Weekly operational review"
    frequency: "Weekly"
    
  - source: "Development team"
    method: "Sprint retrospectives"
    frequency: "Bi-weekly"
```

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Identify gaps from operator feedback
